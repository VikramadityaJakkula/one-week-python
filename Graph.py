# A graph is a common data structure that consists of a finite set of nodes 
# (or vertices) and a set of edges connecting them. A pair (x,y) is referred 
# to as an edge, which communicates that the x vertex connects to the y vertex. 
# In the examples below, circles represent vertices, while lines represent edges.
